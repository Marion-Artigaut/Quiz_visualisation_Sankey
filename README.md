# Sankey visualisation of Moodle quiz responses

> Turning quiz data into actionable insight using Moodle or Inspera response data.

---

## About

This repository supports the UNSW *Teaching News You Can Use* video created by **Marion Artigant**, School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, UNSW Sydney.

This project provides .ipynb codes to visualise student responses from online quizzes (Moodle and/or Inspera) as Sankey flow diagrams from online quizzes, to help educators quickly identify:

- Ambiguous or confusing quiz questions  
- Persistent misconceptions or learning bottlenecks  
- Potential irregular answer patterns (e.g. AI-assisted responses)  
- Opportunities to refine teaching and feedback  

By following the flow of responses, lecturers can transform raw quiz data into evidence-based insight for continuous improvement of assessment design and teaching practice.
